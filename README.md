📦 **Supply Chain Delay Analysis**

This repository contains a practice data analytics project focused on analyzing delivery delays in supply chains using the Olist E-commerce Delivery Dataset. The project leverages Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau for visualization and insights.

⸻

**🔍 Objective**

To identify the root causes of late deliveries in the supply chain and recommend data-driven optimizations to minimize delays and improve customer satisfaction.

⸻

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
	•	Python – Data preprocessing & analysis
	•	Pandas – Data manipulation
	•	Tableau – Interactive dashboards & visualizations

⸻

**📂 Dataset**
	•	Source: Olist E-commerce Delivery Dataset
	•	Description: Contains order, product, customer, and logistics data from a Brazilian e-commerce platform.

⸻

**📊 Project Workflow**
	1.	Data Understanding – Exploring dataset structure & relationships
	2.	Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
	3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends and delay patterns
	4.	Visualization (Tableau) – Building dashboards for delay analysis
	5.	Insights & Recommendations – Highlighting bottlenecks and improvement areas

⸻

✅ **Key Insights**
	•	Delays are highly correlated with delivery distance and logistics performance
	•	Certain product categories face higher-than-average delays
	•	Holidays and weekends contribute significantly to late deliveries

⸻

**🚀 Recommendations**
	•	Optimize last-mile delivery operations
	•	Improve inventory placement strategy to reduce shipping distances
	•	Enhance carrier performance tracking with predictive analytics
